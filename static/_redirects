# Handle potential 404 redirects for changed URLs
# This file can be used with Netlify or similar hosting services

# Common redirects if any URLs have changed
# Example: /old-url /new-url 301

# Redirect trailing slash variations
/posts/* /posts/:splat 301
/tags/* /tags/:splat 301
/series/* /series/:splat 301

# Handle case-insensitive redirects (if needed)
# This requires server-side configuration
