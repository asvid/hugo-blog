# Privacy Policy for Candle Studio

**Effective Date:** September 29, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how Candle Studio ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

Candle Studio is designed with privacy in mind. We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- Personal information (name, email, phone number, address)
- User account information
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- Any data from your recipes or photos

### Information Stored Locally

All data created in Candle Studio is stored locally on your device, including:

- Candle recipes and calculations
- Photos you add to your recipes
- App settings and preferences

This information never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no use of personal data by our servers or services.

All recipe calculations and data processing occur locally on your device using the app's built-in algorithms.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any information because we do not collect any information. Your recipes, photos, and app usage remain completely private to you.

## Data Security

Your data security is maintained through:

- **Local Storage**: All data remains on your device
- **No Network Transmission**: No recipe or personal data is sent over the internet
- **iOS Security**: Your data is protected by iOS's built-in security features

## Third-Party Services

Candle Studio does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any information from users of any age, including children under 13. Since no data is collected or transmitted, COPPA compliance is inherently maintained.

## Data Backup and Sync

Currently, Candle Studio does not offer cloud backup or sync features. Your data is stored only on your device. We recommend using iTunes or iCloud device backup to preserve your app data.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal information, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) are not applicable. However, you maintain complete control over your data:

- You can delete the app and all associated data at any time
- You can clear individual recipes within the app
- All data deletion is immediate and permanent

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us:

**Developer:** Adam Åšwiderski

## App Store Compliance

This privacy policy complies with Apple App Store requirements and iOS privacy standards. Candle Studio does not require any special permissions or access to device features beyond basic storage for app functionality.
