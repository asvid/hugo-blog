[I‚Äôm a pragmatic software engineer with diverse experience](#technologies). I like to write about [Android](/tags/android/), [Design Patterns](/tags/design-patterns) and [everything else](/posts/) I learned on the way.

I have extensive experience with legacy code, as well as launching fresh green-field projects.

Furthermore, I enjoy task automatization with a CI/CD approach in mind and have previously designed and implemented release procedures for mobile apps.

In my spare time, you can find me strumming my guitar üé∏, buried in books üìö, enjoying movies üé•, or indulging in computer games üéÆ. I also have a penchant for outdoor adventures like camping ‚õ∫, hiking üåÑ, and cruising on my motorcycle üèçÔ∏è.

### Projects

Sometimes I build something just because I want to :)

#### [Biedra](https://github.com/asvid/GdzieTaBiedra)

This project started as recruitment task. Since then I rewrote it completly about 3 times, just to play with various libraries. I was changing HTTP stack, databases, presentation layer, I think I even used RxKotlin at some point. But I always had CI, some tests and clean domain layer there, so changing parts of the app was pretty easy.

#### [Remote Logger](https://github.com/asvid/RemoteLogger)

I was once tasked with spiking a vendor library/SDK integration. The problem was - the library was working only in Android `release` app mode, where generally you don't get debugger. And I couldn't make it work. So I wrote a little tool, that gathers logcat logs and sends them via websocket to a listening service. The logs are then printed in HTML with some colors etc.
Recently I rewrote the server thing in GoLanghttps://www.linkedin.com/in/aswiderski/ as purely CLI tool.

#### [Notti](https://github.com/asvid/Notti)

Every one knows how [Builder pattern](/kotlin-builder-pattern/) works. It produces a valid object with some default values that can be overwritten with setters, if something is required it goes to the constructor. Well Google engineers had bit different idea, and I wasted 2 days debugging why notification is not being displayed at all in my app. So I created a little library that would prevent me (and others) from making this mistake again.

#### [Frida playground](https://github.com/asvid/FridaApp)

Sample app and scripts used to hack it using [Frida](https://frida.re/docs/android/). I wanted to play with this tool after some conference, and I didn't find a nice all-in-one guide, [so I wrote one](https://medium.com/android-news/hacking-android-app-with-frida-a85516f4f8b7) and used this project for it.

#### [AirRide]()

Android app for controlling car suspension via Bluetooth. A pet project I did with my brother, he took the hardware part using Arduino and some valves, I did the Android app programming. The app allowed creating loops of commands that could be played from a playlist, using phone accelerometer to send suspension commands, or using more traditional on-screen buttons.
