I’m a software engineer with diverse experience, having worked on educational apps, smart home technology, and large-scale financial tech projects. I prioritize writing clean and understandable code and ensuring its stability through robust testing. While applying SOLID, DRY, and other principles, I aim to avoid hasty abstractions, keeping things as simple as possible for as long as possible to prevent over-engineering.

I have extensive experience with legacy code, as well as launching fresh green-field projects, learning valuable lessons from mistakes made along the way.

With a strong background in mentoring postgraduates, I've guided them through pair programming sessions and shared insights on software design. I also have a knack for recruiting other programmers and forming new teams, particularly within the fintech sector. In these leadership roles, I've steered technical decisions and shaped cohesive codes of conduct to foster effective team collaboration.

Furthermore, I enjoy task automatization with a CI/CD approach in mind and have previously designed and implemented release procedures for mobile apps.

In my spare time, you can find me strumming my guitar 🎸, buried in books 📚, enjoying movies 🎥, or indulging in computer games 🎮. I also have a penchant for outdoor adventures like camping ⛺, hiking 🌄, and cruising on my motorcycle 🏍️.
