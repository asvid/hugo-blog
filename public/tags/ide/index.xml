      <title>IntelliJ IDEA as a LaTeX editor</title>

      <description>IntelliJ IDEA is pretty good at handling LaTeX. I dare say that it is an even better experience than TexStudio or Texmaker, which are dedicated to this type of project. However, the strength of IntelliJ is not in its out-of-the-box capabilities, but plugins and manual configuration of the build process.</description>

      <description>My setup looks like this: I have Windows PC with Linux installed on a separate drive, also I have 2 MacBooks for work, and rarely used Linux ThinkPad. Keeping my IntelliJ settings in sync at all of those machines wasn&amp;rsquo;t really possible. If I find some setting that improves my workflow at my office machine, and after some time I want to work on a pet project on my own PC - I get this itch of not having this setting I had on MacBook&amp;hellip; so I can export my settings and then import it.</description>
