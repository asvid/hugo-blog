      <title>Adapter Pattern in Kotlin</title>

      <description>Purpose As the name suggests, the Adapter pattern transforms the class interface to another one requested by the client. Using the Adapter allows incompatible classes to interact with each other. Another term for this pattern is Wrapper.&#xA;The adapter allows you to &amp;ldquo;map&amp;rdquo; an adapted interface (Adaptee) to the expected interface (Target) by the client class without adding another level of inheritance. Such inheritance would not always be possible if Target was a class rather than an interface.</description>

      <title>Facade Pattern in Kotlin</title>

      <description>Purpose The facade is a very basic pattern, whose task is to obscure the details of a group of classes - the module responsible for some functionality.&#xA;This can be compared to the facade of the building, which in itself has no function. The building consists of rooms, corridors, stairs, installations. It is the facade that indicates the entrance to the building, and the appearance may suggest its purpose.&#xA;The purpose of the pattern is to simplify customer access to the functionality of the obscured module.</description>
