      <description>&amp;ldquo;Post-implementation documentation&amp;rdquo; As the lecturers maliciously called it when they checked university-grade projects, the idea of which was to plan a project, document it, and then implement it according to plan. In practice, I usually was implementing it first so it just worked, and then documented the result. And let anyone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t done that throw a stone first :)&#xA;Lecturers (in Polish universities) are often older people with no commercial experience, used to water-fall project planning.</description>
