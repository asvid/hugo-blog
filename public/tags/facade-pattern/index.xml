      <description>Purpose The facade is a very basic pattern, whose task is to obscure the details of a group of classes - the module responsible for some functionality.&#xA;This can be compared to the facade of the building, which in itself has no function. The building consists of rooms, corridors, stairs, installations. It is the facade that indicates the entrance to the building, and the appearance may suggest its purpose.&#xA;The purpose of the pattern is to simplify customer access to the functionality of the obscured module.</description>
