      <description>Why Recently I had to do some tasks that required me to fallowing a strict checklist. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything complex, no creativity required - just do as list tells you to do. I was also one of the creators of the checklist.&#xA;I had to do it a few times, almost regularly, sometimes in short notice but nothing extreme.&#xA;So obviously I made errors because I knew the checklist so well I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention.</description>
