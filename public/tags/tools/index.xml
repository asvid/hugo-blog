      <description>Respect the Logcat The primary Android developer tool - Logcat. It is so widely used, always at hand, that it is difficult to imagine a situation where you have to work without it. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself in such a situation. And I decided to write and share a tool that helped me survive this drama.&#xA;The challenge I was given a task to test a certain library, and since I work in #fintech, there often are some additional security checks.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer #1: I&amp;rsquo;m an Android developer, not sysadmin. I use terminal to help me with my workflow, not as my main tool, so please keep this in mind :)&#xA;Disclaimer #2: This is based on Linux (Ubuntu), but most stuff should work on OSX also.&#xA;Terminal? If you are a developer (and not a Windows peasant), you might had to use terminal for day to day stuff like installing node.js or python packages, or running scripts.</description>
