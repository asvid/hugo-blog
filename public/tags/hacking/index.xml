      <description>Side image is of course Frida Kahlo auto portrait, besides her name she has no connection with topic&#xA;Motivation Lately I attended to Sekurak hacking party - it&amp;rsquo;s event organized by Sekurak where they show how easy is to hack stuff like IP cameras, routers, phones. I guess Sekurak is known mainly in Poland, but they are real professionals in area of security. During this event Micha≈Ç Bentkowski was showing how easy it is to spy on Android app communication and also change app behavior using tool named Frida.</description>
