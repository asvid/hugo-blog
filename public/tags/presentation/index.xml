      <description>Disclaimer: You probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use MVC in your Android app, there are much better solutions nowadays, that I mention later in this post.&#xA;Hello old friend Model-View-Controller is old indeed, for IT standards at least. Its origins are dating back to the development of Smalltalk-80 in the 1970s. You remember book &amp;ldquo;Design Patterns&amp;rdquo; by the Gang of 4? Yup, its mentioned there (and the book has examples in Smalltalk). It was introduced to address the challenges of creating graphical user interfaces.</description>
