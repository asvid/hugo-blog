      <description>Iâ€™m a software engineer with diverse experience, having worked on educational apps, smart home technology, and large- scale financial tech projects. I prioritize writing clean and understandable code and ensuring its stability through robust testing. While applying SOLID, DRY, and other principles, I try to avoid hasty abstractions, to keep things as simple as possible, for as long as possible, and not over-engineer.&#xA;I have lots of experience with legacy code, but I also started some fresh green-field projects, and learned a lot by mistakes I made there.</description>
